# IMPORTANT: Avoid explicitly setting `indent_style` and `indent_size` for `*`.
#
# EditorConfig doesn't support per-language settings - it only matches files by patterns/extensions.
# This means we can't apply different indent rules based on detected language (e.g., Python's 4
# spaces vs JavaScript's 2 spaces vs Go's tabs). If we set global defaults here, we override
# language-specific preferences, and files without extensions will never pick up the right settings.
#
# WORKAROUND: Instead, we set indentation per-filetype in Neovim's ftplugin files using the
# `vim.fn.set_indent()` function (see modules/nvim/include/.config/nvim/lua/settings.lua). This
# allows proper per-language control regardless of file extension.
#
# A discussion for native language-based EditorConfig support exists but is currently stalled due to
# complexity around language standardization and implementation burden on plugin maintainers.
