# GTK has rewritten this file to add the line:

include "%L"

# This is necessary to add your own Compose sequences
# in addition to the builtin sequences of GTK. If this
# is not what you want, just remove that line.

# Overrides C acute with Ccedilla:
<dead_acute> <C> 			: "ร" "Ccedilla"
<dead_acute> <c> 			: "รง" "ccedilla"
