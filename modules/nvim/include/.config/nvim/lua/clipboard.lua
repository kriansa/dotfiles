-- This effectively replaces the `set clipboard=unnamedplus` option, which sets every yanked text to
-- the system clipboard. The problem with that is that when doing several deletes or changes in a
-- row, the clipboard will keep getting overwritten, as well as calling the system clipboard app
-- every time. On GNOME Wayland, this is particularly slow, because it blocks the UI and steals the
-- focus, causing events such as `FocusLost` and `FocusGained` to be triggered constantly, which is
-- not what we want.
--
-- This way, it will only copy to the system clipboard the last yanked text when the editor loses
-- focus, which is usually when you switch to another application. We also set a timer so we avoid
-- conflicts while alt-tabbing, especially on GNOME where the wl-clipboard steals the focus, causing
-- an infinite loop.
