#   Window settings             #

# WINDOW_TYPE is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard: "unknown", "desktop",
# "dock", "toolbar", "menu", "utility", "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu",
# "popup_menu", "tooltip", "notification", "combo", and "dnd"
#
# Following per window-type options are available:
#
# fade, shadow
#     Controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
#
# opacity
#     Controls default opacity of the window type.
#
# focus
#     Controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused. (By default, all window types except "normal" and
#     "dialog" has this on.)
#
# blur-background
#     Controls wether the window of this type will have its transparent background blurred.
#
# full-shadow
#     Controls whether shadow is drawn under the parts of the window that you normally won’t be able to see. Useful when the window has
#     parts of it transparent, and you want shadows in those areas.
#
# clip-shadow-above
#     Controls wether shadows that would have been drawn above the window should be clipped. Useful for dock windows that should have no
#     shadow painted on top.
#
# redir-ignore
#     Controls whether this type of windows should cause screen to become redirected again after been unredirected. If you have
#     --unredir-if-possible set, and doesn’t want certain window to cause unnecessary screen redirection, you can set this to true.
