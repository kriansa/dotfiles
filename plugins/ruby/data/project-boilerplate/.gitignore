# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore IDE files
/tmp/
/.idea
/.sass-cache

# Ignore local files
*.local

# RSpec state file
/spec/examples.txt

# OS Specifics
*~
*.bak
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini
.DS_Store

# Used by dotenv library to load environment variables.
# .env

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset
