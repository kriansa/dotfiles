# Please use the following guidelines to format your commit
# messages:

#     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <body>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <footer>
#
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, ...)
#             * refactor
#             * test (when adding missing tests)
#             * chore (maintain)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: "change" not
#               "changed"/"changes"
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in
#    imperative present tense
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that
#    this commit closes
#
# Magit tips:
#  - Use `C-c C-c` to commit this message
#  - Use `C-c C-k` to cancel a commit
