# This is a stub for executing docker and docker-compose always as root.
#
# We do it like that so we can temporarily workaround the issue that podman currently doesn't
# support setting userns parameter for the docker-compose API, thus making rootless docker-compose
# not compatible with its docker counterpart.
#
# This is reported and being tracked by `https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/11717`
#
# When this is fixed, please remember to also remove the docker entry on `/etc/sudoers.d/10-wheel`
# See: bugs.md
