# Prepending the $HOME/.bin to $PATH makes it possible for KDE/KWin to find user's own executables
# such as the ones installed by dotfiles manager.
#
# Find out the exact path of the process by running `systemctl status kde@<user>`, getting its PID
# and then executing `sudo strings /proc/<pid>/environ | grep PATH`
#
# On KDE, this PATH is also used to update the user's systemd session PATH env variable (run
# `systemctl --user show-environment` to see it).
Environment=PATH=/home/%i/.bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
ExecStart=startplasma-wayland

# Register the process as a PAM session for the login service, which includes
# pam_systemd. This module registers the session to the systemd login manager.
PAMName=login

# Use a fixed dedicated tty number
# When the TTY is active, the user is granted additional access to local
# devicesâ€”notably display, sound, keyboard, mouse. These additional rights are
# needed to get Wayland working.
