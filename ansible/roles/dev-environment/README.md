# Development Environment

This is usually stuff that I setup for a development machine.

## Caveats

1) I use OpenJDK instead Oracle one. In the past I used to use Oracle setup, 
   but it turned out to be a unecessary pain, because it stopped being
   supported on most distros. I switched to OpenJDK and never had problems with
   it. In the case I really need it back, please refer to commit
   c4cd236976d9c0be426768283e6765114bea75d9.
