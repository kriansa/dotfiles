# Prepending the $HOME/.bin to $PATH makes it possible for KDE/KWin to find user's own executables
# such as the ones installed by dotfiles manager.
#
# Find out the exact path of the process by running `systemctl status kde@<user>`, getting its PID
# and then executing `sudo strings /proc/<pid>/environ | grep PATH`
#
# On KDE, this PATH is also used to update the user's systemd session PATH env variable (run
# `systemctl --user show-environment` to see it). Not sure about GNOME though, but probably it's
# the same.

# When the TTY is active, the user is granted additional access to local
# devicesâ€”notably display, sound, keyboard, mouse. These additional rights are
# needed to get Xorg working rootless.
